А через месяц и вовсе перестал подключаться наушник (то левый, то правый). Может показать заряд 100%, а через несколько минут наушник уже разряжен. Либо при длительном хранении в аккумуляторе, при условии, что все заряжено, перед использованием один наушник может выдать очень низкий.\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div class=\"review__text mt16\">\r\n                                         <span class=\"text-bold\">Недостатки:</span><br> Не рекомендую заказывать именно через сайт.
